It's like having a weight on your shoulders that you can't shake off. First of all, please know that you're not alone in feeling this way. Many people experience low mood and stress, and it's nothing to be ashamed of.\n\nCan you tell me a bit more about what's been going on and how you've been feeling? Is there something specific that's causing you stress, or has it been a build-up of things over time? Sometimes talking about it can help clarify things and give us a better idea of how to move forward.\n\nAlso, have you been taking care of yourself lately? Getting enough sleep, eating well, and doing things that bring you joy can really help with low mood and stress. We can work together to come up with some strategies to help you feel better.\n\nRemember, I'm here to listen and support you, not to judge. You're safe and supported in this conversation. What do you say we take things one step at a time and work together to find some ways to help you feel more positive and less stressed?"}]
